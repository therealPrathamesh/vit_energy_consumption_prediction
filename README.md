# ASL Gesture Recognition

Utilized Python programming language to develop a Deep Learning algorithm (CNN) for real-time recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of 95% in converting to English alphabets. The project includes a user-friendly web interface created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and the model is deployed using Flask.
